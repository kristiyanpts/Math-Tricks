# MathTricks - Az Moga Tuk I Sega 2023 Project

MathTricks is a game played by two players on a local machine. Every one of the players has a figure they move across the board.

## Usage

Opening the website you will be greeted by a game settings page where you select the type of game mode that you want to play - either 1vs1 or against a bot. Then you enter the players usernames and select the size of the board. If you want to you can select to play a series of game - Best of 3 or Best of 5, after witch u press "Play". By pressing it a new page appears with a game board and a game statistics page. Player 1 is the first to go so his possible moves are colored in a light pink color. By pressing one of the options there points will be calculated by the given value. Then Player 2 does the same. The game ends when one of the players has no more possible moves. The winner is the one with more points.

Every player has an even chance at winning with some special values across the board. Fight for them in order to be the best!
